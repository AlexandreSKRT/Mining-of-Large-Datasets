# Mining-of-Large-Datasets
Using Spotify data to implement ML models. Final goal: predict the genre of a song using its musical characteristics.

<i>Languages used : Python :snake:</i>

### 1. Architecture of the project 
- :file_folder: <b>Data</b> <i>(Data Folder)</i> 
  - :floppy_disk: spotify_music.csv <i>(DataSet, Spotify songs)</i>
- :ledger: MusicGenrePrediction.ipynb <i>(Project)</i>

### 2. How to use the project?
This project can be used as an introduction to clustering methods for educational purposis. You will find the different steps of a machine learning project, from data pre-processing to data visualization to results analysis. It combines both naive model theory and applications using [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library.
